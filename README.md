# chainlib

chainlib is a library of helper functions for writing utilities which pass
state to other binaries using [chain loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_loading), 
a technique popularized by [DJB](http://cr.yp.to/).

## Minimal example
```go
package main

import (
	"time"

	"github.com/lwf/chainlib"
)

func realMain() (map[string]string, error) {
	return map[string]string{
		"time": time.Now().String(),
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	chainlib.Main("MYNAMESPACE", realMain)
}
```

```shell
# ./example /bin/sh -c 'echo $MYNAMESPACE_TIME'
